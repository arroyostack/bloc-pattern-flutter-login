# BLOC Pattern Flutter Login App

This application is a simple login form, where users can enter their email and password, and submit the form. The main focus of this application is not on the authentication process, but on the form creation, input validation and implementation of BLOC pattern.

## Features

- BLOC Pattern
- Email input field
- Password input field
- Submit button
- Input validation

## Complexity

BLOC pattern, an alternate way of managing state in a Flutter application. This pattern is highly recommended by the Flutter team and is suitable for larger applications with multiple screens.

## Approach

We build this application twice, using two different approaches:

1. Classic stateful widget approach
2. BLOC pattern

This gives us a chance to compare and contrast the two methods and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Note

This application is built as part of a tutorial by Stephen Grider in the course "Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide." to understand the complexities of state management in Flutter. It does not implement actual user authentication.

Before you can run this project, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. You can download them from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
